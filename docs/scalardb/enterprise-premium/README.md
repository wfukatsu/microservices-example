## Code Generation Rules

### Vector Search Implementation
```java
public class VectorSearchService {
    private final VectorDatabase vectorDB;
    
    public List<SearchResult> searchSimilar(float[] queryVector, int topK) {
        VectorQuery query = VectorQuery.builder()
            .vector(queryVector)
            .topK(topK)
            .build();
            
        return vectorDB.search(query);
    }
}
```

### GraphQL Integration
```java
public class GraphQLService {
    private final GraphQLExecutor executor;
    
    public CompletableFuture<ExecutionResult> executeQuery(String query, 
                                                            Map<String, Object> variables) {
        return executor.execute(ExecutionInput.newExecutionInput()
            .query(query)
            .variables(variables)
            .build());
    }
}
```

### SQL Interface Implementation
```java
public class SQLService {
    private final SQLExecutor sqlExecutor;
    
    public ResultSet executeQuery(String sql, Object... parameters) 
            throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement statement = sqlExecutor.prepareStatement(sql);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < parameters.length; i++) {
            statement.setObject(i + 1, parameters[i]);
        }
        
        return statement.executeQuery();
    }
}
```

### Global Distribution Configuration
```java
public class GlobalDistributionConfig {
    public static ClusterConfig createGlobalConfig() {
        return ClusterConfig.builder()
            .regions(Arrays.asList("us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1"))
            .replicationStrategy(ReplicationStrategy.GLOBAL_CONSISTENT)
            .conflictResolution(ConflictResolution.LAST_WRITER_WINS)
            .consistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.EVENTUAL_STRONG)
            .build();
    }
}
